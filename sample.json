From the moment I arrived, the reception team was welcoming and always smiling, making me feel right at home.\n\nOne of the best things about The Plaza is its prime location in the center of the city. Everything is within walking distance—shopping malls, cafés, and a variety of restaurants—making it the perfect place to stay if you want to explore Tirana with ease.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my stay and highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious and convenient experience in Tirana!",

We deeply appreciate your kind acknowledgment of the aspects you enjoyed, and equally, we are genuinely sorry to hear about the disappointments you experienced during your departure.\nPlease accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused by your interaction with our reception team. We regret that the request to substitute breakfast with a small snack from the minibar was met with inflexibility and that your subsequent appeal for a breakfast refund was declined. We understand how this situation may have seemed unreasonable, particularly given your early departure.\nAdditionally, we are truly sorry for the difficulty you encountered when seeking assistance to arrange a taxi. The explanation provided to you regarding the unavailability of our drivers and the refusal to contact a regular taxi was not in keeping with the standards of service we strive to maintain. Your feedback has highlighted an area where we must improve to ensure that our guests are supported in all their needs, regardless of the time of day.\nWe pride ourselves on offering a five-star experience, and it is disheartening to learn that we did not meet this expectation in your case. Your comments have been shared with our management team, and we are committed to addressing these issues promptly. Training measures will be reinforced to ensure our staff members are better equipped to show flexibility, empathy, and proactive service in addressing guests' requests.\nThank you once again for your valuable feedback. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future and provide you with an experience that truly reflects our high standards.\nKind Regards, \nGeneral Manager",

To my surprise, the receptionist insisted I pay for these items. I agreed, but then requested a refund for the included breakfast which I was unable to utilize. Unfortunately, this request was denied.\r\n\r\nTo add to my frustration, when I asked the reception to order a taxi for me, they claimed this was not possible, stating that all their drivers were asleep. I clarified that I wanted a regular taxi, not a private car service, but they insisted they couldn't help.\r\n\r\nThis level of inflexibility and unhelpfulness was unexpected.  For a hotel that presents itself as a five-star establishment, I expect a higher level of customer service and a more proactive approach to guest satisfaction.  A simple gesture of goodwill and assistance with basic requests would have made a significant difference in my experience."
